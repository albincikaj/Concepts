- Do your current job well
- Identify the tasks your manager dislikes 
- Learn how to do them
- Do them well

Everyone loves doing the shiny things - the strategy and project design. But nobody wants to do the operational coordination. This is a great opportunity to build a name as an operation person. You can build a reputation as a team player that can step in where needed. 

1. Do your current job well: 
 Getting properly onboarded to a role usually takes four to six months. You need to make sure that you can your current job really well. Than the next step is to do it faster or automate it. The idea is to create more free time, to get involved in more projects.

2. Identify the work your manager dislikes:
 Once you have the bandwidth to take on new projects, start to observe your manager (or leadership team) for opportunities to step in.
  - How do they spend their time?
  - What are the top priorities?
  - What do they like to do?
  - What do they not like to do?
 The last one is a low effort for you to get involved and deliver immediate value.

3. Learn how to do those tasks:
 Ask questions, shadow others, and read the documentation to learn how to do the specific activity.
 Try not to bother your manager too much (the whole point is to take work off their plate), but if you have to, sell the vision of what you hope to accomplish: to reduce their workload in the longer term.
 Document everything to create a playbook. Do this by noticing every step required to succeed in the task. Imagine you have to teach someone else how to do the activity down the road.

4. Do them well: 
  Once you've learned the ins and outs of the activity , it's time to execute.
  Apply the rigor that you would do to the other aspects of your job. Don't compromise on quality - and make sure your core work does not suffer from taking on new projects.
